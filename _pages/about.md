I'm Julian. I live in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, where I was born and raised. I graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2018 (Geography & Environmental Systems BA + GIS Certificate with Distinction) and in 2021 (Geography & Environmental Systems MS). During my time as an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant on various projects and served as a lab proctor; as a graduate student I mentored undergrads in my advisor (Dr. Chris Hawn)'s lab. I held several internships over summers/winters, including at the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Assessment Division. I am currently working in product research and development.

My expertise is in data science/statistical programming, but I also have background in social science, environmental and tech policy, and biology.
