I'm Julian. I live in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, where I was born and raised. I graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2018 (Geography & Environmental Systems BA + GIS Certificate with Distinction) and will graduate again in 2021 (Geography & Environmental Systems MS). During my time as an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant on various projects and served as a lab proctor; as a graduate student I mentored undergrads in my advisor (Dr. Chris Hawn)'s lab. I held several internships over summers/winters, my most recent being at EPA's Risk Assessment Division under the Pathways Program.

My expertise is in human geography, but I also have background in anthropology, sociology, computer science, environmental policy/conservation, biogeography, and statistics.

If you'd like to contact me: email `julianholman96 at gmail dot com` or Twitter `easternhercules`. Resume available upon request.
